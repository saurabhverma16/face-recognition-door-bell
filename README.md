# face-recognition-door-bell
My project helps blind or old people , by recognizing a person's face from an image categorizing the result as known (name of person) or unknown , if unknown then identifying person from the image of id card provided and finally sending a notification to users mobile.

It uses openCV module and LBPH (local binary pattern  histogram) face recognizer to predict faces.

It uses tesseract library to recognize text from an id card. 

It uses FCM (firebase cloud messaging) to send notification to mobile.

It uses SMTP library to send emails. 

It uses nexmo to send text messages.
